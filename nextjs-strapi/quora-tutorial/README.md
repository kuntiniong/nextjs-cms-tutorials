This [tutorial](https://strapi.io/blog/build-an-ai-powered-quora-clone-with-strapi-and-nextjs-part-1) is building a Quora clone using Nextjs 14, Tailwind 3.4 and Strapi 5.

We use yarn 1.22.22 as the package manager, then install turbo globally with ```yarn global add turbo@2.1.2"```

### Run the app
```
cd nextjs-strapi/quora-tutorial
turbo run dev --parallel
```
